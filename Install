As an administrator, how do I install and configure an Owncloud server?

As an administrator, how do I enable users to connect to the Owncloud server using the server's IP address and port 8080?

Assumption Windows system

Answer:

Prerequisite:

Check your System Requirements: https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html

Create a Project Directory 

Download docker-compose.yml from[ the ownCloud Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server.git).

Procedure:

To install on your local system:

Create a .env configuration file, with the following configuration settings:

| **Setting Name** | **Description**           | **Example** |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | :---------: |
| OWNCLOUD_VERSION | The ownCloud version      |   latest    |
| OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN  | The ownCloud domain       |  localhost  |
| ADMIN_USERNAME   | The admin username        |    admin    |
| ADMIN_PASSWORD   | The admin user’s password |    admin    |
| HTTP_PORT        | The HTTP port to bind to  |    8080     |

 Start the container as shown below using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Note: You can use any Docker Command-line Tool of your choice.

```console
''''# Create a new project directory
mkdir owncloud-docker-server

cd owncloud-docker-server

# Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud-docker/server/master/docker-compose.yml

# Create the environment configuration file
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION=10.0
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT=8080
EOF

# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d'''
```

Run docker-compose ps to ensure the process is complete and that all the containers have successfully started. If successful, you should expect to see output similar to that below:

```console
Name                Command                       State             Ports
__________________________________________________________________________________________
server_db_1         /usr/bin/entrypoint/bin/s …   Up                3306/tcp
server_owncloud_1   /usr/local/bin/entrypoint …   Up                0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
server_redis_1      /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6        Up                6379/tcp
```

The database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are running, and ownCloud is accessible via port 8080 on the host machine.

|      | Just because all the containers are running, it takes a few minutes for ownCloud to be fully functional. If you run `docker-compose logs --follow owncloud` and see a significant  amount of information logging to the console, then please wait until it  slows down to attempt to access the web UI. |

Question:

As an administrator, how do I add a user account?

Answer:

Procedure:

Log in to the ownCloud UI, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen.

The username and password are the admin username and password stored in the`.env file`.

To create a user account:

Enter a **Login Name** and a initial **Password** (cannot be "0").

(Optional) Assign **Groups** memberships.

Click the **Create** button

Question:

As a user, how do I connect to the Owncloud server using a desktop or mobile client?

Answer:

Prerequisite:

Download the  latest version of the ownCloud Desktop Synchronization Client from the [ownCloud Website](https://owncloud.org/install/#).

Procedure:

In the Installation wizard, select Integration for Windows Explorer. 

This allows users to share files directly from their local ownCloud folder in Windows Explorer, rather than having to open a Web browser and share from the ownCloud Web interface. 

In the next screen, select the installation folder for the client. 

Note: The default is fine; don’t change this without a good reason.

In the next screen, enter your ownCloud server URL.

Check “Trust this certificate”, if your ownCloud server has a self-signed SSL certificate.

In the next screen ,enter the ownCloud login and password.

Select folders and files to sync, and the location of your local ownCloud folder.

The  “Choose what to sync”  opens a file picker.

Note: Any unchecked folders are removed from your local filesystem. On a new installation, when you have not yet synced with your ownCloud server, no files will be deleted.

In the next screen, either click to open ownCloud in a Web browser, or open your local ownCloud folder.

Note:  Open your local ownCloud folder to view file manager integration.  You can also right-click any file or folder, and then left-click “Share with ownCloud” to create a share link. The Share With option available in Windows, is not the ownCloud Share option.
